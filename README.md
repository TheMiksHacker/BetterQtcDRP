# Changes
This is a fork of [another plugin (but whatâ€™s funny, that plugin is also fork)](https://github.com/Clem-Fern/QtcDRP) that has been slightly modified. In this fork changed:
- Changed the images that are displayed in Rich Presence
- Improved code in some places
- Removed the ability to send invitations to Discord (anyway, it will not join them)
- Added support for many file formats (e.g. JavaScript, Python, and QML)

Note: All images in this plugin are taken from the [Papirus icon theme](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme).
